            The Boss Level <br> <br>

My husband and I have three children, and none of them came into the world easily. I didn’t get to hear my children’s first cries when they were born because none of them could physically do so. One day while thinking about each birth, I thought that though all three of them were hard, the difficulty ramped up with each one. Both he and I enjoy video games, so I made the comparison of our third child being “the boss level,” where you have to overcome the greatest challenges. I played the original Super Mario Brothers in my childhood, so I can’t help but think that it’s appropriate that after we beat the boss level, there was a princess waiting for us at the end.

Secondary Infertility<br><br>

We were able to get pregnant with our first two children, two boys, relatively easily but were faced with a few complications during their birth and shortly afterwards. Here is a brief summary of what happened with them.

After trying for a third baby for about 10 years and after many medical tests and procedures, we learned that we would need to go through invitro fertilization (IVF) if we wanted to have another child. Through a few other miracles not discussed here, we were able to procure the funding for this very expensive procedure and found out in March of 2021 that we were indeed pregnant with a baby girl due early September of that year. 
Below is a visualization of infertility rates in America, and proof of the need for infertility treatment to be required coverage of all medical insurance companies.
